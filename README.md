# Open Source Heroes 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️

A simple project to help developers remember the unsung heroes of the open source world, by making it easy to recognize and give them shout outs on social media.

## Why This Exists

Every day, developers use dozens of open source packages that make our work possible. Behind each package are maintainers who often work for free, in their spare time, to create tools that power the modern web.

This project helps you remember to say "thank you" by automatically drafting appreciation tweets when you add new packages to your projects.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: When you commit code that adds a new package, this system notices
2. **Draft Generation**: It creates tweet drafts that thank the maintainers
3. **Your Choice**: Review the drafts and post the ones you like
4. **Spread Gratitude**: Help maintainers know their work is valued

## Setup

1. Copy this folder to your project
2. Add the CLAUDE.md instructions to your workflow
3. Add `.social/` to your .gitignore
4. Commit normally - appreciation drafts appear automatically

## Philosophy

- 🙏 **Gratitude First**: Every draft focuses on thanking maintainers
- 🎯 **Specific Praise**: Mention what you love about their work
- 🌟 **Highlight Impact**: Show how their tool helps you
- 💝 **No Automation**: You control what gets posted

## Join the Movement

Let's make open source appreciation a natural part of our development workflow. One tweet at a time, we can ensure maintainers know their work matters.
